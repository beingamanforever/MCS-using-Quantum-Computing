# MCS-using-Quantum-Computing
Here I focused upon Portfolio Optimisation and forecasting using sub modules offered by qiskit. I also compared how the classical and quantum approaches compare to each other, thus providing a brief insight upon how quantum computing techniques may be used to solve NP hard problems (mean-variance optimization problem in this case)
Taking inspiration from my previous project upon Monte carlo simulation of time series, I have extended the discussion into quantum techniques as I was curious to see how they perform in comparision to classical techniques. 

# About the project
I used a Qiskit simulator (qasm_simulator) to simulate the circuits of qubits, applied hadamard gate superposition to the qubits to generate the portfolios. I also compared the quantum approach with classical optimisation techniques & discussed the differences. Monte Carlo Simulation of the assets was also done to forecast their future variations.
