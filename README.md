# MCS-using-Quantum-Computing
Here I focused upon Portfolio Optimisation and forecasting using sub modules offered by qiskit. I also compared how the classical and quantum approaches compare to each other, thus providing a brief insight upon how quantum computing techniques may be used to solve NP hard problems (mean-variance optimization problem in this case)
